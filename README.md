This repository contains the code necessary to generate all figures from our papers:

Gilman, Kyle, Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, and Laura Balzano. "Grassmannian optimization for online tensor completion and tracking with the t-SVD." IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing 70 (2022): 2152-2167.

Gilman, Kyle and Laura Balzano. "Online Tensor Completion and Free Submodule Tracking with the t-SVD," International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, 2020.

Please cite one of these two. 

All code is in the folder "jupyter_notebooks."
	-TOUCAN code is in the file tsvd.py.
	-Run each Jupyter notebook to generate results for synthetic data, chemo-sensing, time-lapse video experiments.
	-Run the Python script run_all_mri.py to generate MRI results.
	
All necessary datasets are in the folder "Datasets."
