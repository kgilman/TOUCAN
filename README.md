This repository contains the code necessary to generate all figures from our papers:

Gilman, Kyle and Laura Balzano. "Grassmannian Optimization for Tensor Completion and Tracking in the t-SVD Algebra," In review, 2020. http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.11419

Gilman, Kyle and Laura Balzano. "Online Tensor Completion and Free Submodule Tracking with the t-SVD," To appear in International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, 2020.

Please cite one of these two. 


All code is in the folder "jupyter_notebooks."
	-TOUCAN code is in the file tsvd.py.
	-Run each Jupyter notebook to generate results for synthetic data, chemo-sensing, time-lapse video experiments.
	-Run the Python script run_all_mri.py to generate MRI results.
	
All necessary datasets are in the folder "Datasets."
